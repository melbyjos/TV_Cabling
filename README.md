Python experiments for the Reshetikhin-Turaev TQFTs of the torus knot cable spaces. 

These notebooks just contain implementations and experiments associated to part of my dissertation
research, and assumes a fair bit of background mathematics. For anyone interested, the theory,
background, and results of this research are published at:
https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0129167X23500659

and is available open-source at:

Note that this research is joint with Sanjay Kumar.
